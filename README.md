Sentiment Analysis Web Application
This project is a web application designed to perform sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews. It utilizes a Logistic Regression model that has been trained on a dataset of reviews to classify them as either positive or negative. The application is implemented using the Flask web framework, making it easy to set up and use as a lightweight, user-friendly interface for analyzing sentiment.

Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command:

bash
कोड कॉपी करें
git clone https://github.com/Yash-030/Sentimental_Analysis.git
cd Sentimental_Analysis
Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
To avoid conflicts with your system’s Python packages, create a virtual environment:

bash
कोड कॉपी करें
python -m venv venv
Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment depending on your operating system:

On Windows:
bash
कोड कॉपी करें
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
कोड कॉपी करें
source venv/bin/activate
Step 4: Install the Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages using pip:

bash
कोड कॉपी करें
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 5: Download NLTK Data
Some Natural Language Processing (NLP) features require specific datasets. Open a Python shell and run the following commands to download the required NLTK resources:

python
कोड कॉपी करें
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
Step 6: Run the Application
Finally, start the web application by executing:

bash
कोड कॉपी करें
python app.py
Usage
Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

plaintext
कोड कॉपी करें
http://127.0.0.1:5000
On this interface, you will find a text box where you can enter a restaurant review. After submitting the review, the application will analyze it and display whether the sentiment is positive or negative.

File Details:
app.py
This is the main application file that sets up and runs the Flask server. It handles user input, calls the sentiment analysis logic, and displays the results on the web interface.

sentiment_analysis.py
This script contains all the core logic for:

Preprocessing the text data.
Training the Logistic Regression model.
Making predictions based on new reviews.
Reviews.csv
This CSV file contains the dataset of restaurant reviews used for training the sentiment analysis model. It includes labeled examples of positive and negative reviews.

requirements.txt
A list of all Python libraries required to run the application. These include:

Flask
NLTK
Scikit-learn
Pandas, etc.
